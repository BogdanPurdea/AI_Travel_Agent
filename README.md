## About the AI Travel Agent Proof of Concept

This project is a proof of concept for an AI-powered travel agent. It utilizes OpenAI's `runTools` endpoint to call provided tools dynamically, allowing it to fetch and provide relevant travel information. The AI agent assists users in planning their trips by offering insights into weather conditions, available flights, and hotel options based on the selected destination. Developed as a solo project during Scrimba's AI Engineer Career Path.
